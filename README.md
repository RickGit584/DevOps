#   My name is Ricky Williams 
#.   In this repo, you will observe linux bash scripts, ansible configurations, and a network diagram built by me
# BASH SCRIPTS
    # The linux bash script was created in VirtualBox with the Ubuntu Linux distribution
    A simple bash script thats creates directories and files that provides automation and seamless workflow   
#Network Diagram
    A virtual network was built and designed on the IaaS, Microsoft Azure. It includes five virtual machines: A Jumpbox Provisioner, three virtual machines, and an ELK Server. To protect this VPN, one firwall was placed at the edge of the network and one between the jumpbox and the other machines. Redundancy was created with a load balancer amongst the machines
#Ansible Configurations
    # In order to reduce human error and cut down time, Docker containers and Ansible were utilized to streamline the configurations of all the machines
